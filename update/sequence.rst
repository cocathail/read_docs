Updating Annotated Sequences
============================

If you require updates to your short assembled and annotated sequences,
please contact our `helpdesk <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/support>`_ detailing this.
In ENA terminology, "short assembled and annotated sequences" refers to flat-file format entries such as
ITS regions, rRNA genes, and individual CDS records — as distinct from whole-genome or metagenome assemblies.

.. note::

  This does not refer to the update of annotated genome assemblies, please see `Updating Assemblies <assembly>`_
  for information on how to do this.
